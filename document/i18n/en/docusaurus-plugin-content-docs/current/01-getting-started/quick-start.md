# Quick Start

## One-click Startup

Use the following command to start a complete SkillHub environment with one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iflytek/skillhub/main/scripts/runtime.sh | sh -s -- up
```

Or clone the repository and start manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iflytek/skillhub.git
cd skillhub
make dev-all
```

## Access Points

After successful startup, you can access through the following addresses:

| Service | Address | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Web UI | http://localhost:3000 | Frontend interface |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8080 | Backend API |
| MinIO Console | http://localhost:9001 | Object storage management |

## Development Users

The local development environment comes with two test users:

| User | Role | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `local-user` | Regular user | Can publish skills, manage namespaces |
| `local-admin` | Super admin | Has all permissions including review and user management |

Use the `X-Mock-User-Id` request header to simulate user login in local development.
