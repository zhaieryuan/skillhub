# Development Workflow

This document describes the recommended workflow for developing SkillHub locally.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (for dependency services and staging)
- Java 21 (for running the backend locally)
- Node.js 22 + pnpm (for running the frontend locally)
- `gh` CLI (for creating pull requests): https://cli.github.com/

## Stage 1: Local Development (fast iteration)

Use this stage for active development — writing code, fixing bugs, iterating quickly.

### Start the full local stack

```bash
make dev-all
```

This starts:
- Dependency services (Postgres, Redis, MinIO) via Docker
- Backend (Spring Boot) directly on your machine at http://localhost:8080
- Frontend (Vite) directly on your machine at http://localhost:3000

SkillHub now pins a shared Docker Compose project name for local development, so multiple git worktrees can reuse the same dependency containers instead of fighting over `5432`, `6379`, and `9000`.

### Hot reload

**Frontend:** Vite HMR is enabled by default. Save a file and the browser updates instantly.

**Backend:** Spring Boot DevTools is configured. After editing Java code:
1. In IntelliJ IDEA: press `Cmd+F9` (Build Project)
2. If you changed code in another backend module such as `skillhub-domain` or `skillhub-search`, make sure the whole server project is rebuilt, not just `skillhub-app`
3. The backend restarts automatically in 3-8 seconds
4. Watch the terminal running `make dev-server` for the restart log

### Mock authentication

Two mock users are available in local mode (no password needed):

| User ID       | Role        | Header                           |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `local-user`  | Regular user | `X-Mock-User-Id: local-user`   |
| `local-admin` | Super admin  | `X-Mock-User-Id: local-admin`  |

### Useful commands

| Command                          | Description                      |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `make dev-all`                   | Start full local stack           |
| `make dev-all-down`              | Stop all local services          |
| `make dev-status`                | Check status of all services     |
| `make dev-logs`                  | Tail backend logs                |
| `SERVICE=frontend make dev-logs` | Tail frontend logs               |
| `make dev-all-reset`             | Full reset (clears data volumes) |
| `make db-reset`                  | Reset database only              |

### Claude + Codex parallel workflow

When two agents need to work in parallel, do not point both of them at the same checkout. Create isolated task worktrees instead:

```bash
make parallel-init TASK=legal-pages
```

That creates dedicated Claude, Codex, and integration worktrees as sibling directories. Keep `localhost:3000` reserved for the integration worktree only.

After the one-time setup, switch to the integration worktree for the daily merge + verification loop:

```bash
cd ../skillhub-integration-legal-pages
make parallel-up
```

Then verify the merged result at http://localhost:3000.

Because all worktrees share the same local dependency project, you only need one set of Postgres, Redis, and MinIO containers for all of them.

If you need to inspect or resolve merge conflicts before starting the app, you can still split the flow manually:

```bash
cd ../skillhub-integration-legal-pages
make parallel-sync
make dev-all
```

See [13-parallel-workflow.md](./13-parallel-workflow.md) for the full workflow, responsibilities, merge rules, and recovery guidance.

## Stage 2: Staging Regression (pre-PR validation)

Use this stage when a feature or bugfix is complete and you want to verify it works correctly in a Docker environment before pushing.

### What staging does

`make staging` runs a **hybrid** Docker environment:
- **Backend**: built as a Docker image from your local source
- **Frontend**: built as static files (`pnpm build`) and served by Nginx
- **Dependencies**: same Postgres/Redis/MinIO as local dev

This is faster than building both images but still validates the containerized backend and the production Nginx serving path.

### Run staging

```bash
make staging
```

This will:
1. Build the backend Docker image
2. Build the frontend static files
3. Start all services
4. Run smoke tests against the API
5. Print pass/fail summary

If all tests pass, the environment stays running at:
- Web UI: http://localhost
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080

### Stop staging

```bash
make staging-down
```

### View staging logs

```bash
make staging-logs            # backend logs
SERVICE=web make staging-logs  # nginx logs
```

## Stage 3: Create Pull Request

After staging passes:

```bash
make pr
```

This will:
1. Check for uncommitted changes (prompts to commit if any)
2. Push your branch to origin
3. Create a pull request using `gh pr create --fill`

The PR title and body are auto-populated from your commit messages.

> **Note:** `make pr` requires an interactive terminal. Do not use it in CI.

## Full workflow summary

```
make dev-all          # start local dev
# ... write code, test in browser ...
make staging          # regression test in Docker
make staging-down     # stop staging
make pr               # push + create PR
```
